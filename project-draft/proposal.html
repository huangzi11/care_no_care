                    Our project is going to be a web application for restaurants in Seattle. It is a particular problem in Seattle because there is no centralized page for all restaurants in Seattle and for making side by side comparisons between two restaurants. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An information technology problem that occurs would be the lack of features that address the difficulty when it comes to choosing where to eat. While there are already existing food related content based applications, there are limitations when it comes to these apps. First, there is a lack of personalization in their recommendations. Often, the recommendations will be a general list and not based on the user's individual preferences or dietary restrictions. Other potential information technology problems include the overwhelming amount of data especially when it comes to customer reviews. It can be difficult to navigate and users can often experience choice overload to the point where they might exit out of the application and not end up accomplishing their goal: finding a place to eat (The Decision Lab, n.d.).          
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Existing web apps that resemble our project are Yelp and food blog websites like Eater Seattle. However, our web application serves as a more personalized experience for the users compared to the existing web apps through our quiz and comparison features that help aid with their decision making process. Overall, our webpage would offer a more customizable and personalized experience for users and Seattle's eateries. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem that our project can address clearly is that this web would help people with selection difficulties. For numerous individuals, selecting a dining establishment can be an overwhelming endeavor, particularly given the vast array of choices at hand. By consolidating information about all Seattle restaurants in one place, users can quickly access and compare different dining options. This can make the decision-making process more convenient and efficient for locals and tourists alike.

                Users of our application will most likely be individuals of various ages, genders, and backgrounds that like dining out or trying new restaurants and are seeking for restaurant suggestions or comparing different restaurants in Seattle. In terms of the implications for minority communities, this may include taking efforts in the quiz function to ensure that restaurant suggestions take dietary restrictions or preferences into consideration, as well as showcasing restaurants that cater to varied ethnic cuisines.

                In terms of our application functionality, the users of the web app will primarily use it to find restaurants, get recommendations based on their preferences, compare different restaurants, and share their experiences with others. Here are four main features that the app could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Quiz-based Recommendation Engine: The web app could feature a quiz that users can take to help them find restaurants that match their preferences. The quiz could ask about dietary restrictions, favorite foods, preferred atmosphere, budget, and other things that affect restaurant choice. Based on the user's answers, the app could provide recommendations for nearby restaurants that meet their criteria.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Restaurant Comparison Tool: A feature that allows users to compare various restaurants side by side might potentially be included in the app. Users may choose two or more restaurants and compare their menu items, pricing, ratings, and other relevant information. This would help users make informed decisions when choosing between multiple options.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    User Community: The app could feature a community section where users can share their experiences, recommendations, and reviews of restaurants. Users could make posts, leave comments, and talk to other users to find new restaurants and share their own experiences. This would help build a community and provide a platform for users to share their knowledge and connect with others who share their interests.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Searchable Browser: The app will have a search board that allows users to look through all the recommended restaurants based on their past searches and quiz results. To help the users locate restaurants they are searching for, this browser may be sorted by food type, price range, or other detailed information.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                About the information users can gain from our application, they would be able to view various types of information related to restaurants, such as: restaurant name, the physical location of the restaurant, the phone number of the restaurant, the average rating of the restaurant based on user reviews, user-generated reviews of the restaurant, images of the restaurant, menus of the restaurant, categories or cuisines that the restaurant specializes in, information on dietary options such as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free, which can help users find restaurants that cater to their dietary restrictions, information on the restaurant's opening and closing times, etc. We would download the dataset as JSON file from <cite><a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download">Yelp website</a></cite> and we need to filter it by Seattle (Yelp Dataset, n.d.). Also, we might also use the dataset as CSV file from <cite><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oklena/seattle-area-restaurants">Kaggle</a></cite>. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                All in all, as our problem said, choosing a restaurant can be a daunting task, especially when there are so many options available and  people with dietary restrictions may face additional challenges when looking for restaurants that cater to their needs. To address it, the website we proposed, which recommends restaurants based on users' preferences and dietary restrictions, can help to solve the problem of finding the right restaurant that matches the user's preferences and dietary restrictions. By using our app, users can answer a quiz about their preferences and dietary restrictions, which can help them find restaurants that match their criteria. Users can also view ratings, reviews, photos, menus, and other information about restaurants and compare two or more restaurants based on the information they mostly care about, which can help them make informed decisions about where to dine. Furthermore, our app includes a community feature where users can share their experiences and recommendations about restaurants, which can help other users make better choices. This social aspect of the app can also help to create a sense of community among users who share similar interests in food and dining.
